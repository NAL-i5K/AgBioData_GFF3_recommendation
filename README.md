The GFF3 format is a common, flexible tab-delimited format representing the structure and function of genes or other mapped features. However, with increasing re-use of annotation data, this flexibility has become an obstacle for standardized downstream processing. Common software packages that export annotations in GFF3 format model the same data and metadata in different notations, which puts the burden on end-users to interpret the data model.

The AgBioData consortium is a group of genomics, genetics and breeding databases and partners working towards shared practices and standards. Providing concrete guidelines for generating GFF3, and creating a standard representation of the most common biological data types would provide a major increase in efficiency for AgBioData databases and the genomics research community that use the GFF3 format in their daily operations.

The AgBioData GFF3 working group has developed recommendations to solve common problems in the GFF3 format. We suggest improvements for each of the GFF3 fields, as well as the special cases of modeling functional annotations, and standard protein-coding genes. We welcome discussion of these recommendations from the larger community.
